RSM-Server
==========

Really Simple Multiplayer Server

Whats RSM?

RSM stands for Really Simple Multiplayer [Library], a library for built Ludum Dare games. RSM's a Java based library that when finished will allow anyone to quickly and easily add multiplayer support to a Java game. RSM's not meant to be the be all and end all of multiplayer libraries and in fact will support only barebones feautres. However, RSM will be super light weight, easy to use and deployable in minutes, not hours (crucial for Ludum Dare).

How does it work?

RSM is designed to be ready to go. To deploy RSM in your game, grab the source for the client and server. Build the server.jar and deploy to server. Build the client library, drop it into your game and go!

Documentation

You can find some basic documentation for the current (client) build here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/53944475/RSMClient.html

Status

RSM is far from completed and has only a base system setup. It should be ready for the upcoming Ludum Dare in December for any brave souls who'd like to try it.
